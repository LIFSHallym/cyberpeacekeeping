Cyber Peacekeeping is defined as **cyber conflict prevention, mitigation, aftermath containment and rehabilitation with a focus on conflict de-escalation and civilian security**.

## Researchers
Nikolay and Joshua have been working on the concept of Cyber Peacekeeping since 2013, when they met at the [Global Conference on Cyber Space in Seoul, South Korea](https://www.gccs2015.com/seoul-17-18-october-2013). Since then they have published several papers on the subject, given presentations in many countries and are actively seeking more collaboration.
