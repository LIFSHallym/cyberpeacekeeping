I believe the United Nations have the legal framework to approve peacekeeping operations of all types, as we have witnessed over the years. It is not impossible to imagine that the UN, via it's processes, could approve a specific Cyber Peacekeeping (CPK) in an area of the world where standard diplomacy efforts have failed. Considering the UN has moved into Peacemaking where sovereignty issues have been stretches, it would be legitimate to think that CPK operations could represent a logical progression towards creating a climate of greater peace and safety in cyberspace and, therefore, in real space. Enclosed is the presentation I gave to my class on the 21st Nov 2017 at SPU Ottawa, Canada.
