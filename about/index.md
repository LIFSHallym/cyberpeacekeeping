**Cyber Peacekeeping** (CPK) is defined as *cyber conflict prevention, mitigation, aftermath containment and rehabilitation with a focus on conflict de-escalation and civilian security*.

We are a researchers from around the world that see the growing issue of cyber warfare, and believe that the world should be planning on how to make peace. Many countries now have an active cyber military that affect government as well as civilian infrastructure. Few countries, however, are talking about how to mitigate negative effects of cyber warfare, protect civilians and prevent cyber conflict from escelating physical conflict.

# Researchers
Nikolay and Joshua have been working on the concept of Cyber Peacekeeping since 2013, when they met at the [Global Conference on Cyber Space in Seoul, South Korea](https://www.gccs2015.com/seoul-17-18-october-2013). Since then they have published several papers on the subject, given presentations in many countries and are actively seeking more collaboration.
